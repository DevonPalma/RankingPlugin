# --------- items.yml --------- #

# 
# --- PermissionButton ---
# Item:
#    material: the material of the item (ex. Diamond)
#    damage: the material of the item, (Ex. for wool, to get the color red, youd put 14)
#    name: the name of the item
#    lore: the lore of the item: to insert a new line of lore, use %n%
# 
# variables:
#   defaults (gotten from eco.yml)
#       %permission%
#           - the required permission for the item
#       %price% 
#           - the price of the permission
#       %requirement% 
#           - the requirements needed (Only suggested in lore, as it splits into a list)
#       %description% 
#           - the description of an item
#   variable
#       - these are special types of base variables, they will convert themself's to special names
#         for example if you had %material-%GP% and the player has all the requirements but not a perm 
#         this would switch to %material-hasGroup%
#         
# 
#       %offset% 
#           - this is the offset from the center of the GUI;
#             for example if you had 5 rows, row's 1 offset would be 
#             2, because 3 - 1 = 2; 
#       %GP% 
#           - this is a variable name which can either be 
#             hasPerm - the player already owns the permission which is recieved from 
#                       buyable permission
#             hasGroup - this is if the player meets all the requirements of x item as
#                        defined in eco.yml
#             hasBoth - hasPerm and hasGroup are met
#             hasNeither - neither hasPerm nor hasGroup are met
# 
# How to make a variable:
#   VariableName:
#     base: 
#         - this is the only required permission, this will basically tell the variable how to format itself
#           for example - %material% becomes %material-base%. if material-base isn't set, then the item's material
#           will become null, which will throw an error
#     secondaryVariableName:
#         - here you can define whatever name you want, to reference this variable you
#           use %VariableName-secondaryVariableName%,
