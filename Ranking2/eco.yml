# ------------ eco.yml ------------ #
# 
# The Default Path MUST be set
# if it is set to a valid group path
# (which for now must be from permissionsEx)
# then all the groups will be generated
# and all the info required for them!
# 
# 
# example
#   GroupName:
#       permission: the permission a user will gain from buying this permission
#       price: the cost of the permission
#       requirements: a list of requirements a user must meet
#           ingroup: <groupname> - basically if a player is in this group its true
#           hasperm: <perm name> - like above, player requires this permission
#       description: a short description of what the perm gives like for example "allows access to flight
# 
#   Beta:
#       permission: ExamplePerm.Beta.test
#       price: 50.0
#       requirements:
#       - ingroup: Beta
#       - hasperm: ExamplePerm.Alpha.test
#       description: allows access to /beta test
